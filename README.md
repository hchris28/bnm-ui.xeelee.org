# Material Management Prototype

This is a prototype application for a construction company building out solar farms. The requirement was to import field data from receiving logs and scans of pallets once they have been staged. The locations of the inventory can be viewed on a map, and inventory can be searched by key criteria.

You can see the [demo here](https://bnm.xeelee.org/) (user: arthurdent password: dontpanic). Feel free to play around, data is scrubbed frequently.

Source code for the back-end API can be [seen here](https://github.com/hchris28/bnm-api.xeelee.org).

**Please note that this proof of concept was developed quickly and has not been optimized.**
